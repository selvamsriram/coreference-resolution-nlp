<S ID="0">It is now broadly accepted that virulent <COREF ID="X0">APMV-1</COREF> viruses generally arise in <COREF ID="X1">poultry</COREF> by <COREF ID="X2">mutation</COREF> of <COREF ID="X3">viruses</COREF> of low <COREF ID="X4">virulence</COREF> after these viruses have been introduced into poultry <COREF ID="X5">flocks</COREF> (Alexander DJ, British Poultry Science 42, 5-22, 2001).</S>
<S ID="1">Since this <COREF ID="X6">ND</COREF> <COREF ID="X7">virus</COREF> reported from <COREF ID="X8">Victoria</COREF> is almost identical to the 1999 Mangrove Mountain isolate, then it appears more than a remote probability that the same precursor <COREF ID="X9">virus</COREF> (so-called Peat's Ridge strain) may have been present in these Victorian flocks for some time and a very similar mutation event has resulted in this virulent virus.</S>
<S ID="2">Mr. Icahn then proposed that USAir buy TWA, or that <COREF ID="X18">TWA</COREF> buy USAir.</S>
